                    Jerod is the Knobloch Professor of Migration Ecology and Conservation within the Department of Zoology and Physiology at
                     University of Wyoming.  He is also a research associate with the Wyoming Migration Initiative. Jerod is a quantitative 
                     wildlife ecologist with broad interests in understanding how the movement of animals relates to environmental heterogeneity 
                     and change, and how these interactions scale to population- and landscape-level ecological processes. Jerod’s specific research 
                     foci include movement and migration ecology, fitness consequences of behavior, 
                    how cognition and innovation influence foraging behavior, and conservation and management of large mammals.

                    Gabe is some version of an applied quantitative ecologist. He works at the intersection of disease ecology, 
                    population demography, and animal behavior, using data science techniques to provide evidence-based solutions
                      to conservation challenges. Gabe has worked in several wildlife disease systems, from chytrid fungus in amphibians 
                      to sylvatic plague in prairie dogs. At the University of Wyoming, Gabe will explore the extent to which animal movement
                      data can be used to infer behavioral states such as infection with emerging diseases. For instance, Gabe will 
                      use GPS collar data from migrating ungulates to determine whether movement signatures can predict individual 
                      infection status with chronic wasting disease. Outside of work, Gabe enjoys playing basketball, looking for
                        beaver ponds, and watching the Golden Girls.

                      Molly grew up in southwestern Colorado and has a BA in Integrative Biology from the University of California, Berkeley.
                       Her PhD research focuses on ungulate (bison, elk, mule deer, pronghorn, and bighorn sheep) migrations in the Greater Yellowstone
                        Ecosystem. She will be investigating the community and movement ecology of these species to help understand why a large
                         diversity of movement strategies exist among sympatric ungulates. Previously, Molly worked as an Environmental Scientist 
                         with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife where she conducted habitat and wildlife monitoring on state lands
                          and analyzed camera and GPS telemetry data to investigate wildlife use of highway crossings. 
                      In her free time, Molly enjoys hiking in the mountains and traveling.

                    Josh grew up in east Tennessee and received his Bachelor’s degree in Wildlife and Fisheries Science from the University of Tennessee in 2016.  During his undergraduate studies, Josh worked as a field technician assisting with investigations of cattle grazing strategies in native-warm season grass pastures and their effects on nesting songbirds. His research focuses on the winter movement and behavior of golden eagles around anthropogenic stimuli in Wyoming. In his spare time time, Josh can be found wading the waters of the North Platte River, rock-climbing, birding, or hiking with his partner and their two pups Pippin & Myotis.

                    Lucas grew up in Wisconsin, where he earned his B.S. and M.S. in Wildlife Ecology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 
                    There, he studied moose and white-tailed deer spatial ecology. Following this, he worked for the Mule Deer Foundation and 
                    Arizona Game and Fish Department researching and mapping big game migration corridors. His current work is focused on a large 
                    mule deer GPS monitoring project in collaboration with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department with the goal of improving mule deer
                     management and strengthening populations. 
                    Lucas is an avid hunter and fisherman.

                       As an undergraduate, she spent two summers studying arctic foxes in the Canadian High Arctic, where she developed a strong
                        interest in movement ecology. For her MSc, Marie-Pier investigated how forage availability and sociality influence how 
                        GPS-collared elk interact with the Trans-Canada highway in Yoho National Park. Now, Marie-Pier is developing methods to
                         assess how social network analyses can be used to understand the potential for disease spread across large landscapes. 
                         Marie-Pier enjoys spending time in the mountains, 
                      loves being out riding her bike, canoeing down new rivers and skiing powder on cold and sunny winter days.

                    After working numerous field positions ranging from avian studies in Alaska to wolf research in the boundary waters, 
                    she decided to center her focus on GIS methods and its applications in wildlife conservation. Jessie completed her GIS
                     certificate in 2017 and received her master’s degree in GIS at the University of Utah in 2021. In her role at the 
                     Merkle Research Group, she focuses on the interplay of wildlife migration and GIS, supporting data and development
                      needs and conducting analyses on wildlife movement data. 
                    When not tracking wildlife, she enjoys skiing, biking, climbing, and spending time with her husband and dog.

                     State, and an MS in zoology from the University of Wyoming. Broadly, Tana is interested in movement ecology and
                      animal learning and memory. Tana’s research focuses on the reintroduced bison population in Banff National Park,
                       Canada, aiming to understand the underpinnings of how animals learn a novel environment and how that knowledge
                        influences space use and home range formation. In addition, she is interested in how sociality influences learning 
                        and the effectiveness of various interventions, such as prescribed burns and fencing, on space use. When not 
                    in the lab or in the field you can find Tana on the river, riding her bike, or in search of powder with her dog, Goose.

                    Mike has a PhD from Memorial University in St. John’s, Newfoundland, Canada. Mike’s research focuses on how migratory 
                    animals deal with inter- and intra-annual variation in resource phenology. His research aims to bridge behavioral and 
                    spatial ecology by examining consistent individual differences in migratory behavior. His research at the University 
                    of Wyoming focuses on how individuals acclimate—or how populations might adapt—to changing environmental conditions
                     by looking at how individuals acclimate their migration and resource selection behavior as a function of the timing 
                     of spring green-up. Mike enjoys hiking, canoeing and exploring new places.

                    Steffen is a wildlife biologist, fascinated by maps, and widely interested in conservation biology and the understanding of human impacts on wildlife. A B.A. in Geography & Biology and a M.Sc. in Ecology triggered 
                    Steffen’s interest for wildlife biology and movement ecology. After working for a wildlife research institute 
                    in Northern Germany, studying movements of GPS tracked red foxes, he decided to take on a PhD project shared
                     between two Italian research teams and UC Berkeley to study large ungulate movements. Steffen received a PhD
                      from La Sapienza University of Rome studying how human activity affects red deer and elk movements in Europe
                       and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. He currently works as a data science consultant for the Global
                        Initiative on Ungulate Migration (cms.int/gium) and coordinates the large-scale mapping effort to produce
                         a global atlas of ungulate migrations.
                     When not working, Steffen enjoys being outside, likely rock climbing, hiking, or swimming.

                    Justine is a behavioral ecologist broadly interested in understanding the ecological causes of individual behavioral variation and the consequences of this variation at the population- and community-level. Her work focuses on why, when and where animals decide to move, how these individual decisions are affected by spatio-temporal heterogeneity, and their impacts on ecosystem processes. Justine received her B.A. in History and B.Sc. in Biological Sciences from the University of Auckland in her home country of New Zealand. She recently completed her Ph.D. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Princeton University where she studied the movement ecology of antelope in Mozambique’s Gorongosa National Park. At the University of Wyoming, Justine studied the individual drivers of animal movement decisions, focusing on the origin and maintenance of multiple movement strategies in Wyoming’s pronghorn populations. Outside of work, Justine loves being outdoors, hiking, and birding. Justine is now an assistant professor at Montana State University. Justine’s website: jabeckerecology.com.
